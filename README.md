## Questions
How do you implement the tasks in the checklist? Explain in a step-by-step manner (not just copy-paste from the tutorial).

Create a diagram explaining the flow of client requests to a Django web app and its response. Also in the diagram, explain the connections between urls.py, views.py, models.py, and the HTML file(s).

### 3. What is the purpose of a virtual environment? Can we create a Django web app without a virtual environment?
  The main goal of an environment is to guarantee that dependencies, between Python projects are kept separate. This allows Python developers to have isolated environments, for each project making the development process more seamless. Technically it is possible to develop a Django web application without using an environment. However this practice is strongly discouraged, especially when working on projects that have dependencies, such, as various versions of Django. It is highly recommended to utilize environments in order to keep projects separate and avoid conflicts. This ensures development without any compatibility issues.
  
What is MVC, MVT, and MVVM? Explain the differences between the three.
